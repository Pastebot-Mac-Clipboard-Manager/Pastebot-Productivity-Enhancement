## What is Pastebot?

Pastebot redefines the standard copy and paste experience by introducing a suite of powerful features aimed at enhancing productivity. At its core, it is a sophisticated clipboard manager that maintains a comprehensive history of everything you copy. However, its true power lies in the ability to manipulate text before pasting. With custom filters, you can automatically transform text—such as making it uppercase, lowercase, title case, or even applying custom regular expressions.

This application is a vital productivity enhancement for professionals who handle large volumes of text. Imagine copying a list of names from a website and pasting them instantly into a formatted CSV, or copying code snippets and applying proper indentation with a single keystroke. Pastebot makes this possible. It integrates deeply with the operating system, providing a fluid and non-intrusive experience that adapts to your workflow, saving you valuable time and reducing repetitive strain.
